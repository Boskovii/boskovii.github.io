I am an undergraduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, expected to graduate in May 2026. My research focuses on **Human–Robot Interaction**, **Wearable Robotics**, **Haptics**, **Surgical Robotics**, and **Medical Devices**.

Currently, I work in the Exoskeleton and Prosthetic Intelligent Controls Lab, where I design and develop robotic hip exoskeletons. My work includes designing novel thigh interfaces with passive mobility mechanisms, conducting clinical evaluations with stroke-impaired participants, and building multimodal datasets for human-robot interaction research.

I have experience in mechanical design, rapid prototyping, and clinical research, with a strong foundation in robotics, system dynamics, and experimental methods. My goal is to advance wearable robotic technologies that improve human mobility and rehabilitation outcomes.
