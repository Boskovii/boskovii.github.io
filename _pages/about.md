I am an undergraduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, graduating in May 2026. My research focuses on wearable robotics, biomechanical systems, and human-robot interaction. Broadly, I am interested in leveraging user-centered design to improve the functionality and comfort of devices that physically interact with the human body.

I currently work in the Exoskeleton and Prosthetic Intelligent Controls Lab under Dr. Aaron Young, where I lead an undergraduate team developing a robotic hip exoskeleton for post-stroke mobility restoration. My work includes designing and prototyping the exoskeleton's mechanical components, evaluating device performance with stroke-impaired users, and building movement datasets using VICON motion capture, force plates, EMG, IMUs, and insole pressure sensors.

I have a strong foundation in mechanical design, rapid prototyping, and human-subject research. My technical skills span CAD, FEA, carbon-fiber layups, system dynamics modeling, and experimental biomechanics. I am passionate about building wearable robots that integrate with human biomechanics to promote mobility and rehabilitation.
