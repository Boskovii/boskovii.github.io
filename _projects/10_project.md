Working simultaneously on the exoskeleton and dynamometer projects revealed that, despite differences in control architecture and function, these systems share common design challenges at their physical interfaces. I am currently developing an undergraduate thesis that formalizes this observation into a framework for evaluating physical human-robot interfaces in prolonged-contact applications.

The framework will integrate subjective and objective metrics to provide a standardized method that researchers can use to compare designs across different robotic systems while avoiding common mistakes. This work will address a critical gap in the literature: while individual interface designs are often evaluated in isolation, there is no unified framework that enables systematic comparison and optimization across diverse robotic platforms.

## Methods

This research involves: (1) conducting a structured literature review to identify existing evaluation methods and performance metrics; (2) synthesizing insights into a proposed evaluation framework that maps evaluation dimensions (comfort, fit, safety, trust, alignment, force transmission) to standardized metrics; and (3) testing the framework's applicability through case studies on the thigh interface of the robotic hip exoskeleton and the foot mount of the robotic dynamometer I have worked on previously.

## Significance

The adoption of a standardized framework for evaluating physical human-robot interfaces will advance the medical robotics field by enabling researchers to compare interface designs across domains and avoid design mistakes already recognized in other systems. For users, standardized interface evaluation will ensure that designs are developed to prioritize safety, comfort, and usability. More broadly, this work addresses a critical barrier to translating medical robots from academic prototypes into real-world systems accepted by society at scale by building users' trust and confidence in these devices.
