**Exoskeleton and Prosthetic Intelligent Controls Lab** | Aug 2023 – Present

I am designing and developing a robotic hip exoskeleton with a novel thigh interface that addresses a critical challenge in wearable robotics: skin irritation caused by misalignment between the human hip joint and actuator axes. The solution incorporates a passive 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) planar mobility mechanism that allows the exoskeleton to move naturally with the user's body.

## Key Contributions

- **Mechanical Design**: Designed and manufactured a novel thigh interface with a passive 3-DOF planar mobility mechanism that mitigates skin irritation by accommodating misalignment between hip joint and actuator axes

- **Structural Optimization**: Used SolidWorks FEA to improve the structural design of thigh struts, reducing mass by over 35% while maintaining strength and durability

- **Prototyping & Manufacturing**: Fabricated prototypes using SLS/SLA/FDM 3D printing and manufactured final components using wet-laminated and prepreg carbon-fiber layups for optimal strength-to-weight ratio

- **Data Collection**: Collected kinematic datasets from both able-bodied and stroke-impaired participants using VICON motion capture across cyclic and non-cyclic locomotor tasks

- **Multimodal Data Analysis**: Built comprehensive multimodal datasets integrating infrared markers, force plates, EMG, IMUs, insole pressure sensors, and gait mapping. Developed automated validation tools in MATLAB to flag gaps and errors in real-time

- **Clinical Evaluation**: Performed clinical evaluations of stroke participants using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment to correlate movement data with impairment severity, providing quantitative metrics for rehabilitation progress

- **Team Leadership**: Coordinated a team of undergraduate researchers, mentoring new members and supporting technical development across mechanical design, software development, and clinical testing

This project represents a significant advancement in wearable robotics for rehabilitation, combining mechanical innovation with rigorous clinical validation to improve outcomes for stroke survivors.
