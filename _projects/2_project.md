**Physiology of Wearable Robotics Lab**  
*Principal Investigator: Prof. Gregory Sawicki* | Aug 2024 – May 2025

I designed and built a robotic dynamometer as part of a larger open-source ergometer platform used to study human muscle–tendon dynamics. The full system includes a high-precision rotary torque transducer, multi-axis load cells, shear sensing, and interfaces for EMG, ultrasound, and tendon tensiometers. My motor-driven actuation subsystem replaced an open-source weight-stack system with a platform capable of variable-speed and complex loading profiles. The primary goal was to create a system that could **accurately measure isokinetic human plantar-flexion torque** while supporting physiologically meaningful test conditions.

My contributions spanned **diagnosing mechanical limitations in existing platforms**, **designing a new motor-driven dynamometer**, **selecting components through torque-speed modeling**, and **fabricating a structurally rigid, high-force prototype** suitable for human testing.

## Improving Open-Source Force Plate Design
System Identification & Platform Correction

My first role in the lab involved evaluating the design of an open-source ankle work-loop platform. Structural flexion in the force plate was corrupting sensor readings, thus preventing isolation of soleus muscle activity. Through inspection and testing, I identified the exact weak points responsible for the deformation and redesigned the structural components to increase rigidity and improve measurement fidelity. These corrections created a stable baseline for collecting accurate biomechanical signals across the platform’s multimodal sensing suite.

## Mechanical Design of the Motor-Driven Dynamometer

To support isokinetic and variable-speed loading, I designed a new motor-driven dynamometer in Fusion 360 to replace the weight stack entirely. The system integrates a high-torque motor and gearbox that can apply controlled rotational loads at the ankle joint across a wide range of velocities. This mechanical redesign enables dynamic loading patterns that better reflect real-world conditions and expands the types of work-loop experiments the ergometry platform can perform.

## Component Selection & Torque-Speed Analysis

I used MATLAB to generate torque-speed curves for candidate motors and gearboxes, ensuring the final selection could:

- **exceed maximum human plantar-flexion torque**,  
- maintain stable control across all test speeds, and  
- operate without saturating or distorting measurements.

By comparing modeled system response to biomechanical datasets, I verified that the dynamometer could safely handle the full range of human performance during plantar-flexion tasks and interface cleanly with the open-source force plate subassembly and torque transducer.

## Fabrication & Safety Features

I fabricated aluminum brackets and structural bars using waterjet cutting, a chop saw, and a drill press. I designed a reinforced steel motor mount for welding to minimize frame deformation under high loads. I also machined steel hard-stop bars to prevent ankle overextension and ensure safe operation during high-force testing. These fabrication steps were critical for creating a rigid, high-fidelity measurement system capable of safely delivering and withstanding large torques.
