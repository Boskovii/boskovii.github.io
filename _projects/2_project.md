I designed and built a custom robotic dynamometer to replace traditional weight-stack systems, enabling variable-speed and complex loading tests for human ankle work-loop analysis. This system provides unprecedented control and measurement capabilities for studying human biomechanics, allowing researchers to apply dynamic loading profiles that cannot be achieved with static weight stacks.

My contributions spanned the entire development process from system identification and mechanical design through component selection and fabrication, resulting in a functional system capable of exceeding human plantar-flexion torque while maintaining precise control.

## System Identification & Platform Correction

I identified and corrected structural issues in an open-source ankle work-loop platform to increase rigidity and isolate soleus muscle activity. Through careful analysis of the existing system, I determined that insufficient structural stiffness was compromising the accuracy of force measurements and limiting the platform's ability to isolate specific muscle groups. I implemented targeted modifications to improve the system's mechanical integrity and measurement fidelity.

## Mechanical Design

I designed a custom motor-driven dynamometer in Fusion 360 to replace a weight stack, enabling variable-speed and complex loading profiles that cannot be achieved with static weights. The design integrates a high-torque motor and gearbox system with precision control capabilities, allowing researchers to apply dynamic loading patterns that more accurately simulate real-world biomechanical conditions. This mechanical system provides the foundation for advanced work-loop analysis of human ankle dynamics.

## Component Selection & Analysis

I selected motor and gearbox components capable of exceeding human plantar-flexion torque through MATLAB torque-speed modeling and analysis. By modeling the system's dynamic response and comparing it against biomechanical data for human ankle forces, I ensured the dynamometer could handle the full range of human plantar-flexion torques while maintaining responsive control. This analysis-driven approach guaranteed the system's capability to test across the full spectrum of human performance.

## Fabrication & Safety

I fabricated brackets and structural bars via waterjet cutting and drill press operations. I designed a reinforced motor mount for welding and machined steel hard-stop bars to prevent overextension and ensure user safety. The fabrication process required careful attention to precision and structural integrity, as the system must safely handle high forces while maintaining accurate measurements. The safety features, including hard-stop bars, protect both the equipment and human participants during testing.

This project demonstrates expertise in mechatronic system design, from initial concept through detailed engineering analysis to final fabrication and validation.
