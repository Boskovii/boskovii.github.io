**Physiology of Wearable Robotics Lab** | Aug 2024 – May 2025

I designed and built a custom robotic dynamometer to replace traditional weight-stack systems, enabling variable-speed and complex loading tests for human ankle work-loop analysis. This system provides unprecedented control and measurement capabilities for studying human biomechanics.

## Key Contributions

- **System Identification**: Identified and corrected structural issues in an open-source ankle work-loop platform to increase rigidity and isolate soleus muscle activity

- **Mechanical Design**: Designed a custom motor-driven dynamometer in Fusion 360 to replace a weight stack, enabling variable-speed and complex loading profiles that cannot be achieved with static weights

- **Component Selection**: Selected motor and gearbox components capable of exceeding human plantar-flexion torque through MATLAB torque-speed modeling and analysis

- **Fabrication**: Fabricated brackets and structural bars via waterjet cutting and drill press operations. Designed a reinforced motor mount for welding and machined steel hard-stop bars to prevent overextension and ensure user safety

This project demonstrates expertise in mechatronic system design, from initial concept through detailed engineering analysis to final fabrication and validation.
