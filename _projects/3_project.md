**ME3017: System Dynamics** | Jan 2025 – May 2025

I developed a comprehensive dynamic model of human hip and knee joint mechanics to analyze stability, frequency response, and transient behavior under various loading conditions. This project applied advanced system dynamics principles to biomechanical analysis.

## Key Contributions

- **Model Development**: Developed a double-pendulum model of human hip and knee dynamics using torsional springs and dampers to represent ligament stiffness, muscle damping, and gravitational effects

- **Mathematical Analysis**: Used anthropometric data to derive nonlinear differential equations describing the system dynamics, then linearized them about equilibrium to analyze stability, frequency response, and transient behavior

- **Simulation & Validation**: Simulated torques corresponding to real-world activities including martial-arts kicks, soccer strikes, and rehabilitative cycling. Compared nonlinear and linear system performance using MATLAB to understand the limits of linearization

- **System Analysis**: Analyzed stability characteristics, frequency response, and transient behavior to understand how the system responds to different inputs and initial conditions

This project showcases the application of advanced control theory and system dynamics to biomechanical systems, providing insights into human movement that inform exoskeleton design.
