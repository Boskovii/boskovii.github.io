**ME2110: Creative Decisions and Design** | Jan 2024 – May 2024

I designed and programmed an autonomous robot integrating multiple sensor types with various actuators to complete complex tasks. The project required mechanical design, control systems, and rapid prototyping skills.

## Key Contributions

- **Control System**: Programmed an autonomous robot in Arduino integrating IR and ultrasonic sensors with motors, solenoids, and pneumatic actuation for multi-modal sensing and actuation

- **Mechanical Design**: Designed a low-profile scissor lift mechanism extending 4.5 ft from a 4-in collapsed height, enabling the robot to reach elevated targets while maintaining a compact form factor

- **Custom Manufacturing**: Machined a custom aluminum spool on a lathe for the scissor lift mechanism, demonstrating precision manufacturing skills

- **Rapid Deployment System**: Built a rapid-deploy mechanism using drawer slides and pneumatic actuation to clear obstacles, enabling the robot to navigate complex environments

This project integrated mechanical design, control systems, and manufacturing to create a functional autonomous system, demonstrating end-to-end engineering capabilities.
